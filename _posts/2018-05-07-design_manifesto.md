We are designers.

## We will design for ourselves.
We will know why we are designing, and stand by our reasons. Not everyone will agree with what we do, and we do not design for everyone. We are responsible first and foremost for ourselves, know best what we want for ourselves. A design will only be as good as the amount of effort that went into it, and we will only put as much effort into a design as we are willing to. An idea must first capture our attention before we are willing to commit, to turn a vague idea into a concrete design, to design something we can be proud of. If we are motivated to make a good design, we will pour ourselves into the process.

## We will design for an audience.
It is important to think about who a design is meant for. Who will use our design? Who will want to use our design? Who should use our design? Who will pay us as we design? Who will buy our design? We will design for ourselves, but we cannot design only for ourselves. Our work must be appreciated, must be desired. It is not enough that we are satisfied with our design; we must also satisfy others with our design, and that means finding out both what others want and need.

There are many ways of acquiring that information, and all of them include interaction with our intended audience. We need context to design. We should not assume that we can think of every possibility by ourselves, nor should we consider ourselves representative of an audience at large. We must go and research -- conduct interviews, talk to focus groups, send out surveys. Our design process should incorporate this gathered data
 -talk about contextual inquiry, affinity diagramming, storyboarding, personas-

## We will expand our audience.
It is not enough to design for a limited audience or even to think about a limited audience. If there is a person who might be able to appreciate our design, then we must think about that person. We cannot claim to be all-encompassing, to have thought of every single possibility, as we have biases and assumptions that we are not aware of. However, we can aim to include as a wide an audience as we can, and to overcome our limitations.

What are the [affordances and signifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Design_of_Everyday_Things) of our design? Can we increase the number of affordances? Can we make the signifiers clearer? These are all questions we must ask repeatedly in our design process. If we increase the number of ways our design can be interacted with, everyone benefits. Everyone benefits from clear, unambiguous language. So we must think about how to answer these questions, and how to encompass a more inclusive audience. For example, we can make text in our design easier for screen-readers to process. We can allow multiple ways of interacting with our design, such as voice commands or a touch screen. In doing so, [we improve the design for our entire audience.](https://theblog.adobe.com/design-with-accessibility-in-mind-the-pour-methodology/) The easier it is to interact with our design, and the more accessible our design is, the more likely our audience will be expanded, and the better our design will be.

## We will make it beautiful.
Our designs will be pleasing to ourselves and to our audience, delightful to all senses. This will not happen on our first try, or even the fifth.
- talk about prototyping, mockups, user testing, heuristic evaluation -

## Code of Ethics
We will not always agree on what is ethical, but there are some general guidelines that may help. We will:
  - Consider the situation. We cannot anticipate and plan for everything that may happen to us. We will find ourselves in unfamiliar situations, and when that happens, we must think clearly and decisively.
  - Think about the consequences. When we design, we make decisions, and those decisions will have impacts. We must have considered to the best of our abilities how our decisions will affect others. This will help in thinking about which decision is the right one to make.
  - Learn from our mistakes. They will happen no matter how well prepared or thoughtful we may be. When we make a mistake, we must realize how it came to happen, and strive to prevent future iterations of the same mistake to occur. We must not be afraid of making mistakes, as they reveal shortcomings that we were previously not aware of.
  - Listen to counsel. We cannot think of everything ourselves, and we should not pretend otherwise. We must heed what other people say and take their advice into consideration, as they will provide valuable insights.
